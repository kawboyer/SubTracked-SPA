### Premise
SubTracked is an app that tracks your monthly subscriptions (and expenses). These days everyone has subscriptions to services including cloud storage, media streaming, digital magazines, music streaming, food prep services, shaving clubs etc. It's easy to lose track of which you use or get stuck paying after a free trial. With SubTracked you can categorize your subscriptions and get an overview of how much you're spending and on what.

### Functionality
Each user creates their own account where they can easily add all the subscription data relevant to them. Numerous provided subscription services (Amazon Video, Dropbox, Netflix, etc.) will be able to be selected from a menu, or if the service is not list, it can be added as a custom bill. The user selects the category of service, recurring billing period and cost, and this information is stored in a database and rendered in numerous ways for a user to break down their expenses.
